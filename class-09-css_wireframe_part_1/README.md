#### Announcements
 - ***DEEP BREATH***....... This kind of is a catch-up day for us, and also the day we leave the most wide-open and with the least amount of new content involved. Why?
  - Adult learning cycle: we need time to reflect.
  - The labs on each of the next two days are of much lower intensity than the others this week, and easier to work at on your own, leaving you room to get caught up on the Mon-Wed labs.
 - Thursdays noon-1: Office hours with the Admissions team in the front lounge area, if you'd like to talk with Karinne about your next steps. Feel free to talk to Sam or the TAs for any general advice you seek.
 - Today's one-on-one meetings:
 	- 2:30 Darryl
 	- 3:00 Adam
 	- 3:15 Adrienne
 	- 3:45 Lola
 - Today we're focused on reviewing and developing a deeper understanding of what we've been building the past three days, and we're shifting our focus for the remainder of the week more to page layout and UI/UX concerns.
 - We know it's been a hard few days, but the class is doing very well. The TAs and Sam a extremely pleased with how you all help one another.
 - It's not to soon to start thinking about final projects. Let's have a brief conversation about that today, because a week from tomorrow you're going to be divided up into teams, and  a week from tomorrow starting planning on your projects.
 - Tomorrow we'll look at some projects from prior classes and talk a bit about what to expect from Project Week.
